Rules:

1. You may participate alone, or in a group of any size.

2. Only the following namespaces are allowed:
	- ChessChallenge.API
	- System
	- System.Numerics
	- System.Collections.Generic
	- System.Linq
		i. You may not use the AsParallel() function

3. As implied by the allowed namespaces, you may not read data from a file or access the internet, nor may you create any new threads or tasks to run code in parallel/in the background.

4. You may not use the unsafe keyword.

5. You may not store data inside the name of a variable/function/class etc (to be extracted with nameof(), GetType().ToString(), Environment.StackTracks and so on).
	- Very clever ideas though, thank you to #12 and #24.

6. If your bot makes an illegal move or runs out of time, it will lose the game.
	- Games are played with 1 minute per side by default (this can be changed in the settings class). The final tournament time control is TBD, so your bot should not assume a particular time control, and instead respect the amount of time left on the timer (given in the Think function).

7. Your bot may not allocate more than 256mb of memory.

8. All of your code/data must be contained within the MyBot.cs file.
	- Note: you may create additional scripts for testing/training your bot, but only the MyBot.cs file will be submitted, so it must be able to run without them.
	- You may not rename the MyBot struct or Think function contained in the MyBot.cs file.
	- The code in MyBot.cs may not exceed the bot brain capacity of 1024.
